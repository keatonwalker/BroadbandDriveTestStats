** DRIVETIME POINT TO SEGMENT AGGREGATION SCRIPT
** This script is akin to a max raster filter, where the segments operate like a raster filter area of many cells, computing statistics about the values within that filter, but here in a vector environment.
** The script will be run for each of the different sub-files for each acquisition year and carrier (there are 40 total files). For each year and carrier, there are several sub-files that correspond to general link technologies (e.g. GSM, HSPA, LTE).
** The objective of this script is to output a table with a record for each segment containing best connection values (signal strength, upload speed, download speed) for each of the link technologies present.
** The term “link technology” is used loosely… Isotrope made a different file for the general classes of link technology for each acquisition year and carrier… also, there is a nominative link technology field in each file that is a finer detail indicator of the specific technology (e.g. GPRS or EDGE for 2G GSM, or type of CDMA hardware) employed during the connection measured.
** Definitions of variables: signal strength is a negative number with the smaller absolute value being the best signal strength, i.e. -57 is better signal than -110; there is only one “data transfer speed” field in the import files with higher numbers representing faster data transfer; whether the data transfer was an uplink or downlink is recorded in the “direction” field as an “U” or “D”; the “linktech” field is different depending upon the carrier and file – I will adjust this script for each file and modify the hierarchy of this “nominative” data

## Import segment file containing polylines of segments and intersections for Utah roads
import segment file;

## Import drivetime files
** Each “link technology” set of files for each acquisition year and carrier has both a radio link file (with connection information such as signal strength) and a data link file (with data transfer information such as upload and download file speeds).
import radio link point file;  ## fields: lat, long, signal
import data link point file; ## fields: lat, long, linktech, direction [U for upload, D for download], speed

## Create export table and fields (could be a csv export)
create export table;
create “segmentID” field, int type, represents the segment and to be used as key to link all files later on
create “signal” field, int type, equals signal strength, always negative number between ~ -30 and -120
create “uplink” field, int type, equals max upload transfer speed
create “downlink” field, int type, equals max download transfer speed

## Create temp variables
create “signal” variable, int type, initialize to null (preferred), or -200
create “uplink” variable, int type, initialize to null (preferred), or -200
create “downlink” variable, int type, initialize to null (preferred), or -200

for each segment in segment file:
     set buffer at 0.11 miles (5 sec @ 80 mph);
     write to export file;     
     write segmentID from segment file to “segmentID” field in export table;
     initialize “signal,” “uplink,” and “downlink” fields in export field to null (preferred) or -200

     conduct spatial query for all points in RADIO LINK file within the buffer
     ** There may be segments where a carrier did not provide service, so there may be no points, thus the if / else conditional below.
     if: no points then continue, else:
     for each point in buffer:
          ** Must be able to handle null or 0 values in the imported point files
          temp variable “signal” = “signal” value from point if < temp signal var

     ## iteration through all points is complete, set the values in the export file to the temp variables
     export signal = temp var signal;

     conduct spatial query for all points in DATA LINK file within the buffer
     ** There may be segments where a carrier did not provide service, so there may be no points, thus the if / else conditional below.
     if: no points then continue, else:
     for each point in buffer:
         ** Because uplink and downlink speeds are contained in the same field, whether the point record refers to upload or download is indicated by the “direction” field in the point files
          ** Must be able to handle null or 0 values in the imported point files
          temp variable “uplink” = “uplink” value from point if direction = “U” and speed > temp uplink var
          temp variable “downlink” = “downlink” value from point if direction = “U” and speed > temp downlink var

     export var uplink = temp var uplink;
     export var downlink = temp var downlink;

     (for loop advances to next segment)

final write export table, close files;
